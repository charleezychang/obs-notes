- React rerenders from top to bottom. Clean and tidy up the root as much as possible by maximizing Context API, even better to opt for Zustand
- Check for derived states that do not need useState
- Analyze all components (even contexts), use useMemo and useCallback
- Refactor recurring components, either by children prop or making smaller components
- Make sure all array and object manipulation are copied and not mutated due to them being reference type (especially if they are a dependency for useEffect or useMemo)
- Use constants
- Checkk all null checks, unknown, and any types
